A simple riot bot which provides Status about Weblate

# Tests
```
1. npm install
2. npm run start "USERNAME" "PASSWORD"
3. kill npm run start after it got the poll rules
4. npm test
```
``npm run start`` is required as it generates the needed token file. Using "USERNAME" and "PASSWORD" on npm test will propably work too.
